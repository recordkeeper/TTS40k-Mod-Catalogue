# Patch notes: 8/30/20 + Hotfix

Imperial Guard: Updated Taurox and Taurox Prime models. Updated Marauder Destroyer model.

Imperial Knights: Added Knight Perceptor models.

Chaos Knights: Updated Knight Desecrator models.

Hotfix notes:

Thousand Sons: Added missing Screamers of Tzeentch

Daemons: Added new Daemon Princess of Khorne model. Uses the model for Valkia the Bloody from Age of Sigmar.

Note: Due to Mothman's release of his Age of Sigmar Trove, I've restructured the folders for the catalogue so that both can be installed with no overlap. The Saves folder now cotains a "Warhammer 40,000 Catalogue" folder, which contains all the save files. The overall install instructions haven't changed, and all future updates will use this install format so that you can have both collections in your TTS game together without issue.

Installing this hotfixed version of the catalogue will update your file structure, so it is recommended you delete your existing catalogue files and do a fresh install.
